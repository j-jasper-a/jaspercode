### Install Faker

Let's install Faker in our project. The `-D` flag is there to install it as a development dependency since we only need it for development and testing purposes, not for production.

_Inside the code snippets below, I'll typically include the file path as a comment at the top. This isn't Gospel. It's just there to help you understand where code like that should typically go in your project's file structure._

```zsh
# npm
npm install -D @faker-js/faker

# pnpm
pnpm add -D @faker-js/faker
```

### Create a utility function to generate fake data

Let's put Faker to work right away by creating a utility function which will serve as the core of our entire process. It's a simple function that generates whatever data we ask of it and returns it in a structured format. For the purpose of this guide, let's pick an employee as our target resource.

Let's create a file dedicated to this function and import Faker.

```typescript
// src/lib/generators/generate-fake-employee.ts

import { faker } from "@faker-js/faker";
```

Let's work with a simple type definition for an employee and assume that `Employee` has the following structure.

```typescript
type Employee = {
  id: string;
  firstName: string;
  lastName: string;
  email: string;
  avatar?: string;
  currentJob: {
    id: string;
    title: string;
    department?: string;
    startDate: string;
  };
  company: {
    id: string;
    name: string;
    logo?: string;
    email: string;
    phone: string;
    address: string;
    website: string;
  };
  metadata: {
    createdAt: string;
    updatedAt?: string;
  };
};
```

Faker has a many built-in methods. One of the most useful ones is `faker.datatype.boolean()`. It simply returns either `true` or `false`. It has an optional parameter, `probability`, which allows us to control the likelihood of it returning `true`. The default value is `0.5` which is 50%. We can use this to randomize the generation of optional fields in our data structure. Since our `Employee` type has 4 optional fields, we can build a utility function, `randomlyInclude()`, for reusability. This is simply to keep our code [DRY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself). If you find TypeScript generics confusing or prefer not to use it for any other reason, you can safely skip it. For example, I didn't use it for the `avatar` field just as a reference.

```typescript
// src/lib/generators/generate-fake-employee.ts

function randomlyInclude<T>(value: T, probability?: number): T | undefined {
  return faker.datatype.boolean({ probability: probability || 0.5 })
    ? value
    : undefined;
}
```

Now onto the main function that generates a fake employee. This function will return an object of type `Employee` with all the fields populated with random data generated by Faker.

```typescript
// src/lib/generators/generate-fake-employee.ts

function generateFakeEmployee(): Employee {
  const firstName = faker.person.firstName();
  const lastName = faker.person.lastName();
  const companyName = faker.company.name();
  const companyDomain = faker.helpers
    .slugify(companyName)
    .replaceAll("-", "")
    .toLowerCase()
    .concat(faker.helpers.arrayElement([".com", ".net", ".org"]));

  return {
    id: faker.string.uuid(),
    firstName: firstName,
    lastName: lastName,
    email: faker.internet
      .email({
        firstName: firstName,
        lastName: lastName,
        provider: faker.helpers.arrayElement([
          "gmail.com",
          "yahoo.com",
          "hotmail.com",
        ]),
        allowSpecialCharacters: false,
      })
      .toLowerCase(),
    avatar: faker.datatype.boolean({ probability: 0.5 })
      ? faker.image.avatar()
      : undefined,
    currentJob: {
      id: faker.string.uuid(),
      title: faker.person.jobTitle(),
      department: randomlyInclude(faker.person.jobArea(), 0.5),
      startDate: faker.date.past({ years: 5 }).toISOString(),
    },
    company: {
      id: faker.string.uuid(),
      name: companyName,
      logo: randomlyInclude(
        faker.image.dataUri({
          type: "svg-uri",
          height: 512,
          width: 512,
          color: faker.color.human(),
        }),
        0.9,
      ),
      email: `info@${companyDomain}`,
      phone: faker.phone.number({ style: "international" }),
      address: faker.location.streetAddress({ useFullAddress: true }),
      website: `https://${companyDomain}`,
    },
    metadata: {
      createdAt: faker.date.past({ years: 5 }).toISOString(),
      updatedAt: randomlyInclude(
        faker.date.recent({ days: 7 }).toISOString(),
        0.9,
      ),
    },
  };
}
```

Before decorating the employee object, we generate a few supporting values to add more realism to the data. For example, an employee's email is usually based on their name, and a company's domain typically reflects its name. It wouldn't make sense for someone named `Steve Jobs` to have an email like `bill_gates@hotmail.com` while working at a company named `Google` with a domain like `www.ibm.com`.

So, what's happening here?

- `id`: Generates a random UUID
- `firstName`: Uses the pre-generated first name
- `lastName`: Uses the pre-generated last name
- `email`: Generates a random email address based on pre-generated first and last names using a random provider from a predefined list
- `avatar`: Generates a random avatar image URL _sometimes_
- `currentJob`
  - `id`: Generates a random UUID
  - `title`: Generates a random job title
  - `department`: Generates a random company department name _sometimes_
  - `startDate`: Generates a random date in the past
- `company`
  - `id`: Generates a random UUID
  - `name`: Uses the pre-generated company name
  - `logo`: Generates a random SVG image URI _sometimes_
  - `email`: Generates an email address based on the pre-generated company domain
  - `phone`: Generates a random phone number
  - `address`: Generates a random address
  - `website`: Generates a website URL based on the pre-generated company domain
- `metadata`
  - `createdAt`: Generates a random date in the past
  - `updatedAt`: Generates a random date in the recent days _sometimes_

Note that I'm not even scratching the surface of what Faker can do. This isn't Faker's documentation. The chances are that if you can think of it, Faker can generate it. Please refer to the [official Faker documentation](https://fakerjs.dev/api/) and find out how to tailor it perfectly for your needs.

The interesting thing here is that this is the only time we use Faker directly. The rest of the guide will simply invoke this function in various ways to generate fake employees. It's that simple.

### Create functions to fetch fake data

Now that we have a function to generate a single fake employee, we can easily create asynchronous functions to simulate fetching employees from an API. Let's create two: one to fetch a single employee by its `id` and another to fetch all employees. These are extremely common use cases.

Let's also add a little bit of delay to simulate the latency of a real API call. The value is in milliseconds.

```typescript
// src/lib/api/employees.ts

export async function fetchFakeEmployeeById(
  id: string,
): Promise<Employee | null> {
  await new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, 500));

  const employee = generateFakeEmployee();

  employee.id = String(id);

  return employee;
}

export async function fetchAllFakeEmployees(
  limit?: number,
): Promise<Employee[]> {
  await new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, 500));

  const employees = Array.from({ length: limit || 16 }, () =>
    generateFakeEmployee(),
  );

  return employees;
}
```

### What to expect from generated data

Just as a reference, the fake employees will look something like this:

```json

    }
  }
]
```

### Reuse a data set

Sometimes, you might want to reuse the same set of fake employees across multiple components or even coding sessions. This is especially useful when you're having troubles with certain combinations of data and UI components, and you want to ensure consistency throughout your fixes. `faker.seed()` has got you covered.

```typescript
// src/lib/generators/generate-fake-employee.ts

faker.seed(42);
```

Simply put this at the top of the file where you use Faker. You don't have to do anything else. It'll use the same data set every time. The number you pass can be any integer you like. The important thing is that it should not be changed for as long as you want to maintain the same data set. As soon as you change it, Faker will generate a new set of data and then stick to that. Leaving it empty is the same as not using it at all (i.e. random).

### Use fake data to build your UI

And we're done with the whole process. Now, we can use these fake employees to build our UI components as we normally would.

Here's what it would look like in a React (Next.js) component:

```tsx
import { EmployeeCard } from "@/components/employees/employee-card";
import { fetchAllFakeEmployees } from "@/lib/api/employees";

export default async function EmployeesPage() {
  const employees = await fetchAllFakeEmployees(16);

  return (
    <main>
      <div>
        {employees.map((employee) => (
          <EmployeeCard key={employee.id} employee={employee} />
        ))}
      </div>
    </main>
  );
}
```

And here's a Vue.js (Nuxt) component:

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
import { fetchAllFakeEmployees } from '@/lib/api/employees';

const employees = await fetchAllFakeEmployees(16);
</script>

<template>
  <main>
    <div>
      <EmployeeCard v-for="employee in employees" :key="employee.id" :employee="employee" />
    </div>
  </main>
</template>
```

Have fun building your UI out in the wild.
